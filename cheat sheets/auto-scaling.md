# Auto-scaling with the main Azure Compute services
Before diving into the contents, let me recap some basics about scaling.

- Scaling Out/In is the ability of a system to add and remove instances, based on a given compute size, to accommodate a peak/low load. Scaling out/in is also referred to as **Horizontal Scaling**.
- Scaling Up/Down is the ability of a system to increase the amount of resources (CPU, Memory, DTU, RU, IOPS, etc.) **of a given instance**. Scaling up/down is also referred to as **Vertical Scaling**.
